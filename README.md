 # Machine Learning & Statistics Tasks 2020 
Tasks 2020 Assessment by Kevin Dooley

#### Background

This repository contains the completed Machine Learning and Statistics Tasks 2020. These tasks are worth 50% of the total marks for this module. All aspects of this project are to be documented in a single juypter notebook and submitted up to Moodle prior to the project deadline on the 18th December 2020.

Git must to be used document your work and marks will be awarded under the following headings: Research, Development, Consistency and Documentation. 

The project description is detailed in full on the GMIT Moodle page under the 'Task 2020 Assessment' PDF.

#### Objective

The aim of this repository is to clearly research and complete all 4 tasks as per the project instructions. All the tasks are focused on statisitical tests and researching and understanding these tasks can only enhance my knowledge of such topics and help me utilise them in future projects and real world situations. 

This respository contains a single jupyter notebook and a README. The jupyter notebook discusses each task in detail through supportive code and markdown while the README file decribes how to run the notebook and gives a brief outline about each task. 

#### Getting Started

1. If not already installed, download and install Python 3.
2. Recommend downloading Python via the Anaconda download to get useful additional software including Jupyter and iPython. By downloading Anacoda you will also get essential packages such as; NumPy, Pandas, SciPy already built into Python. All of are used within this project.
3. Download and install a command prompt - recommend Cmder (Windows) or Terminal (Mac).
4. To run this jupyter notebook on your computer you will need to download the tasks.ipynb file to your desktop. To do this copy the url https://github.com/kevindooley/Machine_Learning_Statistics_Tasks_2020_Assessment which will bring you to the repository. Click the green 'Code' button on the screen and then copy the link under the HTTPS tab. Paste this link into your command line and complete a Git Pull request. This will then clone the Github repository onto your desktop.
5. Once cloned/downloaded to your desktop, open your command line
6. Using the 'cd' command on your command line, go to the folder you saved the .ipynb file to.
7. Type 'jupyter notebook' or 'jupyter lab' to open up jupyter and click on the .ipynb file to view the jupyter notebook.
8. You can also view the jupyter notebook directly on Github by clicking on the link to my repository https://github.com/kevindooley/Machine_Learning_Statistics_Tasks_2020_Assessment. All commits to this repository can be viewed on Github.
9. Sometimes, the jupyter notebook does not always load on Githib, you can also view on nbviewer using the link https://github.com/kevindooley/Machine_Learning_Statistics_Tasks_2020_Assessment
