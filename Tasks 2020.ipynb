    "\n",
    "A number is defined as an irrational number when it cannot be given as the ration of two integers. One of the most famous irrational numbers is the $sqrt2$. It can be proven that the $\\sqrt2$ is irrational through a proof by contradiction and assuming that the $\\sqrt2$ is rational. [1]\n",
    "\n",
    "From my research there any many different methods which will compute the square root of a number. I decided to use Newtons method. Newton's Method is a very familiar method and suitable for programmatic calculation [2]\n",
    "\n",
    "Newton's method which is also known as Newton-Raphson method is a root-finding algorithm that produces successively better approximations of the roots of a real-valued function. [3] If you have a function $f(x)=0$ and $x_0$ is close to the root of a number, then newthon's method for a derivation formula should mean the $x_1$ would give a better approximation of that root.\n",
    "\n",
    "To find the square root using Newton's method, you guess a solution $x_0$ of the equation $f(x)=0$. As a result, you will find the linear approximation of $f(x)=0$ at $x_0$ and be able to find $x$ intercept of the linear approximation. [6]\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned above, assuming $x_0$ is close to the solution of $f(x)=0$ you will find the approximation of $f(x)=0$ by the tangent line at $x_0$ and determine the $x$ intercept of the tangent line. You then determine the next approximation of the formula $x_1=x_0-\\frac{f(x_0)}{f'(x_0)}$. This is an iterative process in which you keeping determining the next $x$ intercept. The iterative process using the formula $x_n+1=x_0-\\frac{f(x_0)}{f'(x_0)}$ will give you the approximate root. Depending on how many times the iterative process is completed will determine the accuracy of the approximate result. [7]"
