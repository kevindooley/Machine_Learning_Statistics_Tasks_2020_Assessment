    "A number is defined as an irrational number when it cannot be given as the ration of two integers. One of the most famous irrational numbers is the $\\sqrt2$. It can be proven that the $\\sqrt2$ is irrational through a proof by contradiction and assuming that the $\\sqrt2$ is rational. [1]\n",
    "\n",
    "From my research there any many different methods which will compute the square root of a number. I decided to use Newtons method. Newton's Method is a very familiar method and suitable for programmatic calculation [2]\n",
    "\n",
    "Newton's method which is also known as Newton-Raphson method is a root-finding algorithm that produces successively better approximations of the roots of a real-valued function. [3] If you have a function $f(x)=0$ and $x_0$ is close to the root of a number, then newthon's method for a derivation formula should mean the $x_1$ would give a better approximation of that root.\n",
    "\n",
    "To find the square root using Newton's method, you guess a solution $x_0$ of the equation $f(x)=0$. As a result, you will find the linear approximation of $f(x)=0$ at $x_0$ and be able to find $x$ intercept of the linear approximation. [6]\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned above, assuming $x_0$ is close to the solution of $f(x)=0$ you will find the approximation of $f(x)=0$ by the tangent line at $x_0$ and determine the $x$ intercept of the tangent line. You then determine the next approximation of the formula $x_1=x_0-\\frac{f(x_0)}{f'(x_0)}$. This is an iterative process in which you keeping determining the next $x$ intercept. The iterative process using the formula $x_n+1=x_0-\\frac{f(x_0)}{f'(x_0)}$ will give you the approximate root. Depending on how many times the iterative process is completed will determine the accuracy of the approximate result. [7]"

As can be seen from the output, the result does output 100 decimal places but the final 47 digits are showing as 0. This is because on most machines today, floats are approximated using a binary fraction with the numerator using the first 53 bits starting with the most significant bit and with the denominator as a power of two. [9] Normally, up to 53 digits precision would be fine, because that is more digits than most people find useful. It would be common where people may not even need more than 1 decimal point therefore Python keeps the number of digits manageable by displaying a rounded value. Python has limitations to completing this task because of the 53 digit precision. We have been asked to determine the square root of 2 to 100 decimal places. \n",

    "A chi-squared test, also written as $\\chi^2$ test, is a statistical hypothesis test that is valid to perform when the test statistic is chi-squared distributed under the null hypothesis. A well know variant of the Chi-squared test is Pearson's chi-squared test which is used to determine if there is a statistically significant difference between the expected frequencies and the observed frequencies in one or more categories of a contingency table.[1] In other words, chi-square test for independence compares two variables in a contingency table to see if they are related and it tests to see whether distributions of categorical variables differ from each another.\n",
    "\n",
    "Categorical variables are non-numerical and a Chi-squared statistic is a way how a relationship between two categorical variables meaning it is appropiate for this task because the variables are neighbourhood and occupation (categorical).[2] \n",
    "\n",
    "There is no defining number that will indicate whether a chi-square test statistic is large enough to indicate a statistically significant difference or not. In general terms, you can compare your Chi-squared value to the critical value from a Chi-squared table or using the $p$ value. [2][3]\n",
    "\n",
    "If the Chi-squared value you calculated is higher than the critical value, you can assume the data does not fit the model (null hypothesis) and you reject the null hypothesis. If the Chi-squared value is less than the critical value, the data did fit the model and you fail to reject the null hypothesis. [2][3]\n",
    "\n",
    "It is also possible to determine if the difference is significant or not by using the $p$ value of which the Chi-squared test will give you. To determine the $p$ value you require the degrees of freedom (calculate from (row - 1)(column - 1) to determine from a contingency table)[4] and the $\\alpha$ value usually 0.05 (5%).[2][3] \n",
    "In this question,if the $p$ value is < 0.05, you reject the null hypothesis and the variables are determined to be dependent. \n",
    "If the $p$ value > 0.05, you fail to reject the null hypothesis and the variables are determined to be independent.[5]\n",
    "\n",
    "The below is the formula for calculating the chi-square. The python package scipy completes this formula for us effortlessly but basically what is does is:\n",

    "1. Every observed number in table, subtract the corresponding expected number [$O - E$]\n",
    "2. Square the difference [ $(O —E)^2$ ].\n",

    "Standard deviation is a measure of the amount of variation or disersion of a set of values. A low standard deviation indicates that the values in the set tend to be close to the mean whereas a high standard deviation indicates that the values are further away fom the mean and spread out out over a wider range. The standard deviation is calculated as the square root of variance by determining each data point's deviation relative to the mean. [1]\n",
    "\n",
    "The standard deviation is denoted by the Greek symbol $\\sigma$ (sigma) for the population standard deviation and the Latin letter $s$ for the sample standard deviation. The standard deviation has a huge number of applications, it it used particulary in the financial sector where standard deviations of price data are frequently used as a measure of volatility and predict performance trends. [2].\n",
    "\n",
    "STDEV.P and STDEV.S are both excel functions for calculating the standard deviation of a set of values. STDEV.P calculates standard deviation based on the entire population given while STDEV.S estimates the standard deviation based on a sample, but STDEV.S assumes the given arguements are are a sample of a population[3][4]. STDEV.S can be used to partially correct sample bias. These two standard deviations - sample and population standard deviations - are calculated differently. \n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned above, the standard deviation is a measure of how much variance there is in a set of numbers compared to the average (mean) of the numbers. STDEV.S uses `n − 1` instead of `n` in the formula for the sample variance and sample standard deviation where `n` is the number of observations in a sample. This is called Bessels correction and it corrects the bias in the estimation of the population variance and partially corrects the bias in the estimation of the population standard deviation. The reason the `n-1` only partially corrects bias for the estimation of the standard deviation is because the sample variance is an unbiased estimator of the population variance (remember standard deviation is the measure of variance)but its square root, the sample standard deviation, is a biased estimate of the population standard deviation; because the square root is a concave function. [7]\n",
    "\n",
    "Bessel's correction can provide a better estimation of the standard deviation when working with sample population. \n",
    "STDEV.P does not use Bessel's correction and STDEV.S does include it. Confusion can often arise as to which standard deviation function to use due to the names. STDEV.S (sample standard deviation) could be incorrectly interpreted as meaning the standard deviation of the smaller sample itself and not the estimate of the population standard deviation based on the sample. It is important to know the difference.[6]\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Calculate the mean ($\\mu$) of all data points (N) \n",

    "3. Square the sum of $(x_i-\\mu)$\n",
    "4. Add all the squared deviations together\n",
    "5. Divide the sum of the squared deviations by the number of datapoints (N) to get the variance.\n",
    "6. Get the square root of the variance to get the population standard deviation ($\\sigma$)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sample standard deviation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\bar{x}=\\sqrt\\frac{\\sum(x_i-\\bar{x})^2}{n-1}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Calculate the mean ($\\bar{x}$) of all data points (n -1) \n",
    "2. Subtract the mean from each datapoint. The differences are called deviations. \n",
    "3. Square the sum of $(x_i-\\bar{x})$\n",
    "4. Add all the squared deviations together\n",
    "5. Divide the sum of the squared deviations by the number of datapoints (n-1) to get the variance.\n",
    "6. Get the square root of the variance to get the sample standard deviation ($\\sigma$)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Terminology**\n",
    "\n",
    "Population Standard Deviation (STDEV.P): a set of numbers that contains ALL members of a group (everybody in the population)\n",
    "\n",
    "Sample Standard Deviation (STDEV.S): a set that contains some members of a population [5]\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to use each one?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The population standard deviation would be used if: (1) you have the entire population (N) or (2) you have a sample of a larger population, but you are only interested in this sample and do not wish to generalize your findings to the population.\n",
    "You can use the sample standard deviation to estimate a population if you have a sample, but you wish to make a statement about the population standard deviation from which the sample is drawn. [6]\n",
    "\n",
    "**STDEV.P** - when you have data for the entire population or you have a sample of data but you only want the standard deviation for that sample. You do not need to extrapolate the data for the entire population. [8]\n",
    "\n",
    "**STDEV.S** - large sample and you want to approximate standard deviation for the entire population\n",
    "\n",
    "#### STDEV.P vs STDEV.S in Excel\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Image 1 - STDEV.P on Population\n",
    "<img src=\"images/stdevp-pop.PNG\" width=\"500\">\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Image 2 - STDEV.P on Sample\n",
    "<img src=\"images/stdevp-sample.PNG\" width=\"500\">\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Image 3 - STDEV.S on Sample\n",
    "<img src=\"images/stdevs-sample.PNG\" width=\"500\">\n",
    "\n",
    "It is clear from the above images that there is a difference in calculation between STDEV.P & STDEV.S. If you compare image 2 & image 3, both use the same data in their calculation but end up with a different result. As mentioned above, that is because STDEV.S utilises `n-1` and is an estimate of the population as a whole but STDEV.P is showing the exact standard deviation of the sample itself. It is not an estimate of the population. If you use STDEV.P on sample data to estimate a population, your result may be way off of the actual standard deviation depending on the data in the sample. \n",
    "\n",
    "STDEV.P - you calculate statistics for an entire population (mean, variance, etc.). The results are accurate because all data is available, it is not suitable for estimating. \n",
    "When you calculate statistics for a sample, results are estimates and therefore not as accurate. STDEV.S uses Bessel's correction which is an adjustment made to correct for bias that occurs when working with sample data. When working with a sample population, STDEV.S can provide a better estimation of the standard deviation. [8]\n"
